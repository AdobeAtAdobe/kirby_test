# Overview
[Adobe@Adobe](http://www.adobeatadobe.com) decided to make our code open source. This means we need to create consistent and readable documentation between our repositories. Our ultimate goal being to encourage people to use and contribute to our code repositories by making it easy.

## Setup
This documentation goes over how to clone and setup the documentation template repository into an existing code repository. You will need to be using Mac OS X and have XCode commandline tools installed (for git and Ruby). We will go over this in detail in the [setup](setup.html) section.

## Style
Customization of the template involves modifying sass and html files in the repository. We can also make use of the markdown language features as we write content. The changes can then be pushed to your code repository and any original template changes can be pulled in when needed. We will go over this in detail in the [style](customize.html) section.

## Content 
This documentation is only a template and guideline, therefore the content should be changed to describe how to use the code in the respository in which it resides. For instance, we will change the title from "A@A Documentation" to "Awesome JS Code Project". 

We want the code to be readable and user friendly so we follow a simple style guide to achieve this. We will go over how to change the content and write new content in detail in the [content](content.html) section.
