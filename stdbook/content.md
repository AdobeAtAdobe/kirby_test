[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) gem that transforms plain text into static websites and blogs. Here, we will briefly cover overriding Jekyll's layout files to make your documentation as readable as you would like it (or at the least tolerable). You can learn more about customizing Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If you have videos, you can create a videos directory and it should be likewise detected and added to the generated web content.

## <a name="markdown" class="anchor">Markdown</a>

Our [Jekyll configuration](setup.html#jekyll_config) uses the Kramdown engine for Markdown processing. You can find many references online to help you get started like the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Markdown allows you to apply structure to your text documents. The Kramdown engine will process all *.md files into html and place them in the _site directory to be served as web content. You can place all of your Markdown files in the root of the project directory.

You will see that this template structure contains index.md, background.md, setup.md, etc. These can be used as examples.
